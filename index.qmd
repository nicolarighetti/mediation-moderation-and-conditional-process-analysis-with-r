author: Dr. Nicola Righetti, PhD
---

## Aims, contents and method of the course

This data analysis seminar focuses on linear regression analysis to explore questions about mediated and moderated effects.

Computer applications will focus on R statistical language, the Rstudio environment ([https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/))Â and the PROCESS software by Andrew F. Hayes ([http://processmacro.org](http://processmacro.org/)).

## Learning outcomes

By the conclusion of this course, students should be proficient in:

-   Executing and comprehending the outcomes of linear regression, moderation, mediation, and conditional process models.

-   Statistically testing competing theories of mechanisms through the evaluation of indirect effects in models that encompass multiple mediators.

-   Representing and investigating interactions in regression models to accurately interpret interaction effects.

-   Calculating and inferring about conditional indirect effects to estimate the contingencies of mechanisms.

-   Utilizing the R language and PROCESS to conduct, depict, and comprehend linear regression, moderation, mediation, and conditional process models.
