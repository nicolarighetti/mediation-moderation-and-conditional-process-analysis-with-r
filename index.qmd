title: "Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis with R"
author: Dr. Nicola Righetti, PhD

## Aims, contents and method of the course

This data analysis seminar focuses on linear regression analysis to explore questions about mediated and moderated effects.

Computer applications will focus on R statistical language, the Rstudio environment ([https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/))Â and the PROCESS software by Andrew F. Hayes ([http://processmacro.org](http://processmacro.org/)).

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, participants are expected to know how:

-   Run and interpret the results of linear regression, moderation, mediation, and conditional process models.

-   Test competing theories of mechanisms statistically through the comparison of indirect effects in models with multiple mediators.

-   Visualize and probe interactions in regression models to interpret interaction effects appropriately.

-   Estimate the contingencies of mechanisms through the computation and inference about conditional indirect effects.

-   Use the R language and PROCESS to run, visualize, and understand linear regression, moderation, mediation, and conditional process models.
